- 👋 Hi, I’m @esmakov, a computer science senior at the University of Rochester!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and Redux this summer in hopes of finding an internship in frontend web development.
      My roadmap for the future is to learn the MERN stack and start creating fullstack web projects of my own.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that need a frontend dev.
- 📫 How to reach me - edwardsmakov@gmail.com or esmakov@u.rochester.edu
